**Colors:**  
To make sure all our website’s colors are visible to everyone including people with the most common types of daltonism, we chose to use a black, white, and grey color palette. We chose to change the external app colors to bold, daltonism-friendly ones as well.

**Website**:  
![][image3]         ![][image4]          ![][image5]  
       \#000000                     \#FFFFFF                      \#F4F4F4

**Apps**:  
![][image6]![][image7]  ![][image8]  ![][image9]  ![][image10]  
      \#E60000               \#001DDA             \#BB00FF            \#1DC000              \#946500

**Font:**  
“Kantumruy”  
A smooth font has been selected, ensuring each character is highly readable. In addition, font supports bold styling, allowing some text to be put forward, for better visibility.

**Navbar:**  
Due to our simplistic style, the desire for ease of access, and the limited number of pages required, a horizontal navigation bar with four to five icons was chosen for desktop and mobile.
