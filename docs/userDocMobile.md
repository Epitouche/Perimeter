## What is it ?

This app is a tool to automate tasks in your digital life. Think of it as a personal assistant that connects your favorite services—like Gmail, Microsoft, or Dropbox—and makes them work together. For example, you can set it up to automatically save email attachments to your cloud storage or post updates to multiple social media platforms at once. The app simplifies repetitive tasks, letting you focus on what really matters.
