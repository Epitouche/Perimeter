## Main Document

[main documentation](../../README.md)

## Icon

We chose to create an icon to represent our app and its functionalities..
**![Area Logo][image1]**

## Style

We chose to use simple and minimalist style to ensure it’s easy to use for everyone, despite little experience using websites or a handicap.
**![Widgets][image2]**

## Colors

To make sure all our website’s colors are visible to everyone including people with the most common types of daltonism, we chose to use a black, white, and grey color palette. We chose to change the external app colors to bold, daltonism-friendly ones as well.

**Website**:
![Black Color][image3] ![white Color][image4] ![Grey Color][image5]
\#000000 \#FFFFFF \#F4F4F4

**Apps**:

![Red Color][image6] ![Blue Color][image7] ![Purple Color][image8] ![Green Color][image9] ![Brown Color][image10]
\#E60000 \#001DDA \#BB00FF \#1DC000 \#946500

## Font

`Kantumruy`
A smooth font has been selected, ensuring each character is highly readable. In addition, font supports bold styling, allowing some text to be put forward, for better visibility.

## Navbar

Due to our simplistic style, the desire for ease of access, and the limited number of pages required, a horizontal navigation bar with four to five icons was chosen for desktop and mobile.
