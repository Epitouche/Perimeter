## Main Document

Refer to the [main documentation](../README.md).

---

## 1. Overview

- **PostgreSQL**: An open-source, object-relational database known for standards compliance, extensibility, and powerful SQL support.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database designed for scalability and flexibility, focusing on document-oriented data storage.
- **MySQL**: A widely-used relational database, known for its simplicity and speed in read-heavy operations.

---

## 2. Data Model

- **PostgreSQL**:
  - Relational model with support for JSON/JSONB for semi-structured data.
  - Advanced features like arrays, window functions, and custom types.

- **MongoDB**:
  - Schema-less, document-based model (BSON format).
  - Excellent for hierarchical or flexible data structures.

- **MySQL**:
  - Purely relational with limited JSON support (less efficient compared to PostgreSQL).

---

## 3. Performance

- **PostgreSQL**:
  - Excels in complex queries and analytical workloads due to advanced indexing (GIN, GiST) and full-text search.
  - Write operations are robust with ACID compliance.

- **MongoDB**:
  - Superior performance for write-heavy, unstructured, or hierarchical data.
  - Uses sharding for horizontal scaling but lacks ACID transactions for distributed setups.

- **MySQL**:
  - Optimal for read-heavy applications and simple queries.
  - Can struggle with complex analytical queries or highly concurrent writes.

---

## 4. Ecosystem and Tools

- **PostgreSQL**:
  - Broad ecosystem with extensions like PostGIS (geospatial data) and TimescaleDB (time-series data).
  - Mature support for ORMs (e.g., Sequelize, Prisma).

- **MongoDB**:
  - Rich ecosystem with tools like Atlas (cloud database) and Realm (mobile database).
  - Strong integration with Node.js and modern web frameworks.

- **MySQL**:
  - Ecosystem revolves around web applications (e.g., LAMP stack).
  - Tools like phpMyAdmin and MySQL Workbench simplify database management.

---

## 5. Developer Experience

- **PostgreSQL**:
  - SQL features and extensions make it highly versatile.
  - Learning curve for advanced features can be steeper.

- **MongoDB**:
  - Flexible schema makes onboarding easy for developers new to databases.
  - Requires careful design to avoid performance bottlenecks.

- **MySQL**:
  - Simpler SQL and broader usage result in a gentler learning curve.
  - Limited modern features compared to PostgreSQL.

---

## 6. Scalability and Availability

- **PostgreSQL**:
  - Vertical scaling is strong; horizontal scaling possible with tools like Citus.
  - Replication and failover mechanisms are robust.

- **MongoDB**:
  - Designed for horizontal scaling via sharding.
  - High availability with replica sets.

- **MySQL**:
  - Supports replication but lacks native sharding.
  - Limited horizontal scaling compared to MongoDB.

## 7. Use Cases

| Feature               | PostgreSQL                        | MongoDB                    | MySQL                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Structured Data**   | Excellent                        | Possible (with effort)    | Good                 |
| **Unstructured Data** | Good (via JSON/JSONB)            | Excellent                 | Limited              |
| **Analytical Queries**| Excellent (window functions)     | Limited                   | Limited              |
| **Scalability**       | Strong with extensions           | Excellent                 | Moderate             |

## 8. Popular Applications

- **PostgreSQL**: Reddit, Instagram, Airbnb.
- **MongoDB**: Uber, eBay, Lyft.
- **MySQL**: WordPress, YouTube, Twitter.

## 9. Conclusion

For the **AREA** project, PostgreSQL was selected because:

1. **Relational and Non-Relational Data**: Supports both structured and semi-structured data with JSONB, fitting diverse requirements.
2. **Performance**: Optimized for complex queries and data integrity.
3. **Scalability**: Extensions and replication offer flexibility for growth.
4. **Standards Compliance**: Ensures portability and adherence to ACID principles.

MongoDB could be considered for use cases requiring dynamic schema or real-time updates, while MySQL might fit simpler web applications or read-heavy workloads. PostgreSQL strikes a balance between flexibility, reliability, and power, making it the ideal choice for **AREA**.
