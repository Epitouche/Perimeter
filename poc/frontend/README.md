| **Criteria**                            | **Angular**                                    | **Nuxt**                                          | **Remix**                                      |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Positive Points**                     | - Complete and powerful framework             | - Based on Vue.js, easy to learn<br>- Automatic route generation<br>-Universal rendering | - Optimized performance<br>- Advanced server-side data management |
| **Negative Points**                     | - Steep learning curve<br>- Complexity in integrating libraries | - Less suited for very complex applications | - Will become part of React Router v7<br>- Few resources and libraries available<br>- Documentation isn't explicit nor up to date. |
| **Library Integration Complexity**      | - Sometimes complex integration due to strict structure | - Simplified integration thanks to the Vue.js ecosystem | - Smooth integration with modern libraries, but requires adjustments |
| **Adaptability for Large Applications** | - Very well-suited for large applications due to its robust structure | - Suited for medium to large projects, but may require adjustments for very large ones | - Excellent for modern applications, but may need specific architecture for very large projects |

We chose **Nuxt** because our application is of medium size, one team member has expertise in it, and itâ€™s easy for the rest of the team to use. This allowed us to dive straight into development without spending time learning more complex frameworks like Angular. Moreover, Nuxt offers built-in optimizations, making it a perfect fit for our project.
