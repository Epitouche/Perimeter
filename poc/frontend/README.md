## Comparative Table

| **Criteria**                            | **Angular**                                    | **Nuxt**                                          | **Remix**                                      |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Positive Points**                     | - Complete and powerful framework             | - Based on Vue.js, easy to learn<br>- Automatic route generation<br>- Universal rendering | - Optimized performance<br>- Advanced server-side data management |
| **Negative Points**                     | - Steep learning curve<br>- Complexity in integrating libraries | - Less suited for very complex applications | - Will become part of React Router v7<br>- Few resources and libraries available<br>- Documentation isn't explicit nor up to date. |
| **Library Integration Complexity**      | - Sometimes complex integration due to strict structure | - Simplified integration thanks to the Vue.js ecosystem | - Smooth integration with modern libraries, but requires adjustments |
| **Adaptability for Large Applications** | - Very well-suited for large applications due to its robust structure | - Suited for medium to large projects, but may require adjustments for very large ones | - Excellent for modern applications, but may need specific architecture for very large projects |
| **Accessibility**                       | - Strong built-in support with ARIA attributes<br>- Angular CDK accessibility package | - Vue.js ecosystem provides accessibility plugins (e.g., `vue-axe`)<br>- SSR improves screen reader compatibility | - Relies on React accessibility patterns<br>- Requires manual setup for advanced features |

## Why Choose Nuxt?

We chose **Nuxt** because:
1. Our application is medium-sized, and Nuxt scales well for such projects
2. The team has existing Vue.js expertise
3. Built-in optimizations like automatic route generation
4. **Accessibility advantages**:  
   - Leverages Vue's accessibility-friendly template syntax  
   - Easy integration with accessibility plugins (`vue-axe`, `eslint-plugin-vuejs-accessibility`)  
   - Server-side rendering improves baseline accessibility for SEO and screen readers
5. Faster onboarding compared to Angular's complexity
6. Balanced ecosystem maturity vs Remix's newer architecture

The combination of Nuxt's accessibility tooling, reduced learning curve, and strong Vue.js ecosystem allows us to implement WCAG compliance efficiently while maintaining development velocity.
