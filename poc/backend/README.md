# Comparative Study Backend Technology

Here’s a comparative study of Golang, Gleam, and Java for the backend of the "AREA" project:

## Comparative Table

| **Criteria**                     | **Golang**                                      | **Gleam**                                        | **Java**                                      |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Concurrency and Performance**   | Excellent with goroutines; lightweight threads for high concurrency and real-time tasks. | Limited by Erlang/OTP, though scalable for distributed systems. | Strong with thread management and parallelism, but more complex to manage efficiently. |
| **Microservices & API Support**   | Strong with built-in HTTP support and microservices design. | Well-suited for microservices, but ecosystem is still maturing. | Very mature ecosystem with frameworks like Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for microservices. |
| **Ease of Deployment**            | Easy with static binaries, Docker, and minimal dependencies. | Seamless in containerized environments but may face limitations due to small ecosystem. | Supports Docker and cloud integration but can have heavier images and slower startup. |
| **Libraries and Ecosystem**       | Rich ecosystem with libraries for OAuth2, databases, and testing. | Smaller but growing ecosystem, particularly in functional programming. | Vast ecosystem with extensive libraries for almost any need (OAuth2, REST APIs, databases). |
| **Community and Documentation**   | Large, active community with rich documentation and support. | Smaller community, emerging ecosystem, fewer resources. | Mature community with extensive documentation and support. |
| **Learning Curve**                | Easy to learn with simple syntax, but explicit error handling can be cumbersome. | Steeper for those unfamiliar with functional languages. | Steep for frameworks like Spring but widely taught and documented. |
| **Error Handling**                | Verbose but explicit error handling (no exceptions). | Explicit and robust error handling with a functional approach. | Often verbose, particularly in exception handling. |
| **Performance (Raw)**             | Excellent for high-performance, real-time applications. | Suitable for scalable systems but not optimized for CPU-intensive tasks. | Good performance, though JVM-based apps can be slower than Go. |
| **Scalability**                   | Very scalable, especially in cloud environments like Kubernetes. | Scalable within the Erlang/OTP ecosystem, suitable for distributed systems. | Excellent scalability, especially with microservices and cloud-native solutions. |
| **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  | Supports all platforms through static binaries. | Works well in environments supporting Erlang/OTP. | Runs anywhere with JVM; cross-platform compatibility is a core feature. |

## Why Choose Golang?

- **Concurrency**: Go’s concurrency model with goroutines is a perfect fit for real-time, action-reaction applications, ensuring high performance even under heavy loads.
- **Simplicity**: With a simple syntax and fewer abstractions, Go reduces the complexity of the backend development process, which is crucial for rapid prototyping and scaling.
- **Deployment**: Go’s static binaries simplify deployment, especially when using Docker and cloud environments, without worrying about external dependencies.
- **Ecosystem**: The rich library ecosystem and strong community support ensure that Go can handle various challenges, from integrating OAuth2 to providing excellent database support.
- **Performance**: Go’s performance, particularly in concurrency-heavy applications, makes it ideal for real-time systems like the "Action-Reaction" project.

In conclusion, while Gleam and Java have their strengths, Go’s ease of use, concurrency model, and deployment simplicity make it the best choice for this backend project.
